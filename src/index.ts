// event-hog: a remote MCP server over Cloudflare Artifacts.
//
// One Artifacts repo per event (namespace `event-hog`). Everyone on the team adds
// the same server to Claude as a custom connector, each with their own key in the
// URL, so every write is a git commit authored by the person who made it.
//
// Reads and writes both go through git: the Artifacts binding manages repos and
// mints tokens, but can't write files, so each request clones the repo into an
// in-memory filesystem with isomorphic-git, works on it, and (for writes) commits
// and pushes. A push rejected because a teammate pushed first is retried from a
// fresh clone. Writes add files or append to them, so a retry just re-applies.

const INSTRUCTIONS = `event-hog is a shared workspace for a team working an event together: prep before, contacts and notes during, follow-ups after. Every write is a git commit attributed to the person using this connector.

How to use it:
- First time, or when someone says "get started" or "set me up": call get_started and follow what it returns. It asks which company they represent and which conference they're going to, then gives the playbook for before, during, or after the event. If whoami says the connector has no name yet, do this before anything else.
- Skills: list_skills shows the team's playbooks; get_skill loads one before doing that kind of work (e.g. augment-speakers-panelists when someone shares a speaker card or asks who a speaker is). get_config returns this person's and the organization's settings for a skill, such as which research tools to use.
- Starters: whenever someone logs a contact, adds a note, or saves a speaker profile, load parallel-content-generation-starters (once per conversation) and follow it. Answer the person first; starters come after, short, and never block logging. Flash cards for acronyms, vocabulary, concepts and market standards go in the shared deck with save_flash_cards; flash_cards reads it. Post drafts (tweets, threads, LinkedIn, blog) go in drafts/ with save_draft and add_to_draft, in the company voice for official pieces and the person's own voice for theirs (get_config). Nothing is ever posted from here.
- Slides and other images: an image attached in chat can't be passed to a tool. If you have a code-execution sandbox, the attachment is a file there: upload_link gives a one-time URL to send it to the event's image host with curl (slides become slides waiting for notes; badges, cards, photos and PDFs return a /media/ URL to put in the contact or note). If the sandbox can't reach the host, or there is none, give the person their slide_capture_link (a camera page that shrinks and saves photos under their name) and don't retry the upload. Then list slides needing notes, look at each with view_slide, and write them up with save_slide_notes (load the capture-slides skill first).
- Brand: get_design_system returns the organization's DESIGN.md; if there is none, extract_brand reads the company site and maintain-design-system says how to draft one. When a batch of slides is written up, ask whether any are worth recreating in the brand (recreate-slides-in-brand); every recreation credits its source on the slide.
- Start with event_brief to see the event, the team, the prep docs, and what's been logged. Tools use the current event (the one on today, else one that ended in the last week, else the next) unless you pass event; list_events shows them all. new_event starts a workspace for a new event from the kit's template: confirm the official name, dates, city and time zone with the person first, then offer the event-prep skill.
- Before logging a contact, search for them: log_contact appends to an existing contact (matched by email, then name) instead of making a duplicate, but a quick search shows what teammates already know.
- log_contact takes whatever the person gives you: a typed note, a badge or business-card photo you've read, or a voice memo transcript. Never invent fields. Leave unknown ones out.
- Contacts__Met.csv at the workspace root lists everyone the team met, regenerated on every log_contact; contacts_csv rebuilds and returns it. Attendee lists in prep/ are reference, not contacts: never log someone as a contact from an attendee list alone.
- add_note is for anything that isn't one person: a session takeaway, a theme from the floor, an idea.
- recent_activity shows what teammates logged and when.
- Locations are human-defined and nested (define_location); a person or org can have many (link_location), and who_is_in finds everyone inside a place, nested places included.
- query_crm answers structured questions (who at an org have we met, which orgs relate to which, open follow-ups) from the agnostic-crm database, which log_contact keeps in step with the files.
- CRM: contacts start as hubspot_status pending. If the user has a HubSpot connector, crm_queue lists what's pending: everyone the team met by default, or only the contacts certain people met with met_by (["me"], or ["me", "Michael"]). Each pending contact shows who logged it and their HubSpot email: make that HubSpot user the contact owner (find them with search_owners by that email). Propose the HubSpot records, create them only after the user approves, then call mark_crm_synced with the HubSpot ID. crm_queue also lists conversations not yet in HubSpot: log each as a completed meeting associated with the contact (owned by whoever had it) and each follow-up as a task, then call mark_touchpoints_synced with their IDs. Never mark something synced that wasn't created.
- If the HubSpot connection isn't working (no HubSpot connector, sign-in fails, or HubSpot calls error), don't keep retrying and don't stop logging. log_contact is the raw record: it saves every contact to the shared files and the agnostic-crm database whether or not HubSpot works. At each stopping point (end of a conversation, a break, end of the day) run export_hubspot_csv: it writes everyone still pending into a HubSpot-ready import file, committed under exports/, for a bulk import later. Tell the user that's what happened.`;
